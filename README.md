# üß† Ultimate Tic Tac Toe ‚Äì Human vs AI

Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a strategic twist on the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. In this implementation, you play against a competitive AI that uses **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning** for decision-making, ensuring intelligent and fast responses.

## üéÆ Game Concept

In **Ultimate Tic Tac Toe**, the game board is made up of 9 smaller Tic Tac Toe boards arranged in a 3x3 grid ‚Äì forming a large ‚Äúmeta-board‚Äù.

### Rules Overview:

- Each move you make within a **small board** also determines which board your opponent will be sent to next.
- The position of your move (1 through 9) maps directly to one of the 9 small boards.
- For example, placing your symbol in the **top-left cell (position 1)** of any board will send your opponent to the **top-left board** next.
- If the target board is already completed (won or tied), the opponent can choose any unfinished board.

### Victory Conditions:

- Winning a **small board** secures that cell in the **global board**.
- To win the game, a player must capture **three small boards in a row** (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) ‚Äì just like classic Tic Tac Toe but on the global scale.

## üìê Board Layout

Each of the 9 small boards and the global board follow a standard Tic Tac Toe layout:

1 | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
7 | 8 | 9
---------

- The **meta-board** is also structured using this layout.
- Once a small board is won, it will be marked with a stylized `"X"` or `"O"` across its cells.
- If it ends in a tie, all cells will be filled with `"T"`.

## ü§ñ AI Features

- Implements **Minimax** with **Alpha-Beta Pruning** for deep, strategic evaluation of the game tree.
- Intelligent local and global decision-making: the AI evaluates both the current board and the overall state.
- Automatically reroutes its strategy if forced into completed boards.
- Includes time-limited recursion to ensure real-time responsiveness.
